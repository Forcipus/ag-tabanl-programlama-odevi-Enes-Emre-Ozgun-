                        A <strong>high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) </strong> is a type of gas-cooled nuclear reactor which use 
                        uranium fuel and graphite moderation to produce very high reactor core output temperatures. All existing HTGR 
                        reactors use helium coolant. The reactor core can be either a "prismatic block" (reminiscent of a conventional 
                        reactor core) or a "pebble-bed" core. China Huaneng Group currently operates HTR-PM, a 250 MW HTGR power plant 
                        in Shandong province, China. 
                        <br><br>
                        The high operating temperatures of HTGR reactors potentially enable applications such as process heat or 
                        hydrogen production via the thermochemical sulfur–iodine cycle. A proposed development of the HGTR is 
                        the Generation IV very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) which would initially work with temperatures of 
                        750 to 950 °C.

                    The use of a high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor for power production was proposed by in 1944 by Farrington 
                    Daniels, then associate director of the chemistry division at the University of Chicago's Metallurgical 
                    Laboratory. Initially, Daniels envisaged a reactor using beryllium moderator. Development of this high 
                    temperature design proposal continued at the Power Pile Division of the Clinton Laboratories (known now as 
                    Oak Ridge National Laboratory) until 1947. Professor Rudolf Schulten in Germany also played a role in 
                    development during the 1950s. Peter Fortescue, whilst at General Atomics, was leader of the team responsible 
                    for the initial development of the High temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR), as well as the Gas-cooled 
                    Fast Reactor (GCFR) system.
                    <br><br>
                    The Peach Bottom unit 1 reactor in the United States was the first HTGR to produce electricity, and did 
                    so very successfully, with operation from 1966 through 1974 as a technology demonstrator. Fort St. Vrain 
                    Generating Station was one example of this design that operated as an HTGR from 1979 to 1989. Though the 
                    reactor was beset by some problems which led to its decommissioning due to economic factors, it served 
                    as proof of the HTGR concept in the United States (though no new commercial HTGRs have been developed there since).
                    <br><br>
                    Experimental HTGRs have also existed in the United Kingdom (the Dragon reactor) and Germany (AVR reactor and 
                    THTR-300), and currently exist in Japan (the High-temperature engineering test reactor using prismatic fuel with 
                    30 MWth of capacity) and China (the HTR-10, a pebble-bed design with 10 MWe of generation). Two full-scale 
                    pebble-bed HTGRs, the HTR-PM reactors, each with 100 MW of electrical production capacity, have gone operational 
                    in China as of 2021.

                    The neutron moderator is graphite, although whether the reactor core is configured in graphite 
                    prismatic blocks or in graphite pebbles depends on the HTGR design.

                    The fuel used in HTGRs is coated fuel particles, such as TRISO fuel particles. Coated fuel 
                    particles have fuel kernels, usually made of uranium dioxide, however, uranium carbide or uranium 
                    oxycarbide are also possibilities. Uranium oxycarbide combines uranium carbide with the uranium 
                    dioxide to reduce the oxygen stoichiometry. Less oxygen may lower the internal pressure in the 
                    TRISO particles caused by the formation of carbon monoxide, due to the oxidization of the porous 
                    carbon layer in the particle. The TRISO particles are either dispersed in a pebble for the 
                    pebble bed design or molded into compacts/rods that are then inserted into the hexagonal graphite 
                    blocks. The QUADRISO fuel concept conceived at Argonne National Laboratory has been used to better 
                    manage the excess of reactivity.

                    Helium has been the coolant used in all HTGRs to date. Helium is an inert gas, 
                    so it will generally not chemically react with any material. Additionally, exposing 
                    helium to neutron radiation does not make it radioactive, unlike most other possible coolants.

                    In the prismatic designs, control rods are inserted in holes cut in the graphite blocks that make up the core. The VHTR will be controlled like 
                    current PBMR designs if it utilizes a pebble bed core, the control rods will be inserted in the surrounding graphite reflector. 
                    Control can also be attained by adding pebbles containing neutron absorbers.

                    The design takes advantage of the inherent safety characteristics of a helium-cooled, graphite-moderated core with specific 
                    design optimizations. The graphite has large thermal inertia and the helium coolant is single phase, inert, and has no 
                    reactivity effects. The core is composed of graphite, has a high heat capacity and structural stability even at high 
                    temperatures. The fuel is coated uranium-oxycarbide which permits high burn-up (approaching 200 GWd/t) and retains fission 
                    products. The high average core-exit temperature of the VHTR (1,000 °C) permits emissions-free production of high grade 
                    process heat. Reactors are designed for 60 years of service.

                    Additionally, from 1969 to 1971, the 3 MW Ultra-High Temperature Reactor Experiment 
                    (UHTREX) was operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory to develop the technology of 
                    high-temperature gas-cooled reactors. In UHTREX, unlike HTGR reactors, helium coolant 
                    contacted nuclear fuel directly, reaching temperatures in excess of 1300°C.
